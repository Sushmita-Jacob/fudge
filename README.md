# fudge
This project was made for the Fudge Fudge Fudge YSWS by Hack Club. It is a remake of the official Fudge website (fudge.hackclub.com) in order to be more accessible. I included important information that the original website lacked, like an allergy notice and the submission deadline. This project was made with static HTML and CSS.
